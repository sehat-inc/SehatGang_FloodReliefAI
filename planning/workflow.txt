		- Dashboard (Resource Allocation)

2. Backend 
	
	- Django -> REST for resource tracking 
	- OR Tools -> resource optimization 
	- PostreSQL and postGIS -> Setup this first 
	- Crew AI: 
		1. Flood Scout Agent -> Flood or not (Not implementing) (Future work)

		2. Resource Allocater Agent -> OR Tools and Database: algo will run all the agent has to do is summarize results and pass it on to the next agent. 

		3. SMS Alert Agent -> Will summarize results for every person in the local area -> We might have the agent send SMS in both english and the top language spoken there.
 
		4. Social Media Scout -> Tools such as latest news from X/other sites (don't know if this should be implemented yet) (Save this for the end)
